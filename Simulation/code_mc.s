# Goal of the program
	# 1) Wait a bit
	# 2) Check buttons state
	# 3) Light leds depending on button
# Special
	# Led(0) indicates if we are waiting (for measurement)
main:
	# Time a bit before reading buttons again, near 127.1 ms
	#   x1 is i
	#   x20 is target, count to arnd. ((524'288 * 4) - 2)*4 (4 instr. in loop, the last only 2, *4 clocks by instr (beq only 3 but meh, arnd.))
	#   x2 is slt res.
	#   x3, x4 (1) are for blinking wait led
	mv   x1 x0
	sub  x3 x3 x4
	andi x3 x3 1
	or   leds leds x3
wait:
	slt  x2 x1 x20
	beq  x2 x0 wait_end
	addi x1 x1 1
	beq  x0 x0 wait
# Timer is done, check which leds to light depending on buttons
wait_end:
	beq  btns x0 btns_off


# Any button is pressed if we did not branch
